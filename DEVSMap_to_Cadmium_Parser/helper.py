def prefix_states(text, list_of_state_variables):
    '''
    Replaces each instance of "variable" by "state.variable" in text, when "variable" is followed 
    by a space or semicolon.  This restriction prevents replacing substrings that are not 
    state variables (For example, we would avoid replacing "targetnumber" by "targetstate.number" 
    if there was also a state variable called "number"). This replacement occurs for all state 
    variables in list_of_state_variables.

    Args:
        text (str):                             The input text which we are requiring to prefix the 
                                                state variable names with "state."

def build_conditional_statements(data, list_of_state_variables):
    '''
    Constructs and returns if-else statements from dictionaries where the keys are conditional 
    statements and the values are instructions to execute when the conditional statement is true.
    In Cadmium, this is used to generate the bodies of the internal transition function, external 
    transition function, confluent function, output function, etc.

    This function uses the prefix_states() function to ensure that all state variables are properly
    syntaxed in C++, meaning they are of the form "state.variable_name".

    Possible cases are listed below:

    1.  If the only key is "otherwise", and there is no data: The function in question is not implemented

    2.  If "otherwise" is the only key, this is the only statement to be executed, and the returned 
        statement will not be nested in an if-else structure.

    3.  If there are keys defined that are not called "otherwise", the if-else structure will be generated 
        via the build_conditional_statements_helper() function.

    Args:
        data (dict):                            The DEVSMap dictionary containing the conditions as keys, 
                                                and the execution instructions as values, to be converted 
                                                to an if-else C++ structure.
        list_of_state_variables (dict_items):   The list of state variables for the atomic model currently 
                                                being generated.  This is returned by atomic_model['s'].items().
